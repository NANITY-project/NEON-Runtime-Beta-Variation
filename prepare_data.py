prepare_data.py -- pulls and formats the NECTAR-1.5B pretrain + SFT mix into
pre-tokenized .bin files that ConversationDataset (train_nanity_fixed.py)
can load directly, with NO tokenization step at train time.

WHY .bin INSTEAD OF JSONL:
  This script now runs the exact same tokenization pipeline the trainer used
  to run at train-start (apply_chat_template + crop_preserving_answer, both
  imported from nanity_data_format.py so the two scripts can never drift out
  of sync) and writes the resulting (ids, mask, is_answer) arrays straight
  to disk in nanity_data_format's .bin layout. train_nanity_fixed.py detects
  a .bin path and loads it with a single streaming pass -- no JSON parsing,
  no chat-template application, no cropping, no separate pickle cache (the
  .bin file already IS the cache). The tokenizer used to write a .bin file
  is recorded in its header, so passing the WRONG --tokenizer at train time
  is caught with a loud warning instead of silently corrupting token ids.
  JSONL is still accepted by the trainer for data that didn't go through
  this script, but everything pulled here now goes straight to .bin.

Pretrain (Phase 1 "warmup"), target ~8B tokens:
  FineWeb-Edu (sample-10BT config)         ~4.5B tokens
  Proof-Pile-2 (arxiv + open-web-math + algebraic-stack, interleaved) ~2B tokens
  StarCoderData (bigcode/starcoderdata, a few languages interleaved) ~1.5B tokens

SFT (Phase 3 "finetune"), reasoning mix:
  OpenThoughts3-1.2M   subsampled to 600k
  OpenCodeReasoning    subsampled to 200k
  Bespoke-Stratos-17k  full (17k) -- final polish pass, kept in its OWN file

IMPORTANT -- vocab/tokenizer mismatch:
  NanityConfig.nanity_1_5b() hardcodes vocab_size=50257 (plain GPT-2 BPE),
  NOT the 200064-vocab Phi-4-mini-instruct tokenizer that train_nanity.py
  defaults to. If you train the 1.5B preset with the default --tokenizer,
  the tokenizer will emit ids >= 50257 and you'll get an out-of-range
  embedding index (crash, possibly late into a run if the offending token
  is rare). Use --tokenizer gpt2 for BOTH this script and the training
  command. Role/control tokens ("<|system|>" etc.) are NOT in the plain
  GPT-2 vocab, so they'll BPE-tokenize as ordinary text (a few tokens
  instead of one) -- that's fine functionally, just slightly less clean
  than a true single-token control marker. This script always tokenizes
  with the SAME tokenizer you train with, so pass --tokenizer to override
  if you go a different route (e.g. a GPT-2 tokenizer extended with added
  special tokens -- but then you must also bump vocab_size in
  modeling_nanity.py's nanity_1_5b() to match, or you'll get the same
  out-of-range crash from the new token ids).

TOKENIZER BACKEND (tiktoken vs HF):
  tiktoken's "gpt2" encoding is byte-for-byte identical (same merges, same
  ids) to HF's GPT2Tokenizer, so it's a safe drop-in ONLY for --tokenizer
  gpt2. Any other tokenizer (e.g. the 200064-vocab Phi-4-mini tokenizer
  used by the 4B preset) has no tiktoken equivalent -- there's no way to
  guarantee identical ids, so this script always uses HF for anything that
  isn't in TIKTOKEN_EQUIVALENTS below. When gpt2 IS requested, pass
  --tokenizer-backend auto (default) to benchmark both backends on a
  sample and pick whichever actually encodes faster on this machine,
  rather than assuming tiktoken wins (it almost always does -- it's a Rust
  extension -- but the benchmark is cheap and removes the assumption).

MULTI-CORE TOKENIZATION:
  Both HF's fast (Rust-backed) tokenizers and tiktoken release the GIL
  while actually encoding/decoding, so a plain ThreadPoolExecutor gets
  real parallelism across cores for the CPU-bound tokenize+chunk step,
  without the pickling overhead multiprocessing would add for streaming
  dataset iterators. Pulling rows off the network (streaming=True) stays
  single-threaded in the main thread -- that part is I/O bound, not CPU
  bound, so more threads there wouldn't help. Worker count defaults to
  the number of cores actually available to this process (via
  os.sched_getaffinity on Linux, which respects container/cgroup CPU
  limits -- more accurate than os.cpu_count() on a shared cloud instance),
  override with --workers.

Requires: pip install datasets transformers tqdm --break-system-packages
Optional (faster gpt2 tokenization): pip install tiktoken --break-system-packages

Usage:
  python3 prepare_data.py --out-dir data/ --tokenizer gpt2 --max-len 8192
  # writes data/pretrain_mix.bin and data/sft_reasoning.bin (+ a
  # separate data/sft_polish.bin for the small curated final pass).
  # --max-len MUST match --max-seq-len/context_length at train time -- see
  # the module docstring in train_nanity_fixed.py.
